# **App Name**: EmpTrack Portal

## Core Features:

- Secure Authentication: Secure login and authentication functionality to protect sensitive employee data using JWT in HTTP-Only cookies + bcrypt.
- Role-Based Access: Role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive functions and information based on user roles (e.g., 'admin' vs. 'viewer').
- Employee Directory: Employee list view to display essential employee information.
- Employee Form: Employee form and input validation using React Hook Form + Zod.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#3B5998) evokes trust, authority, and stability, suitable for an administrative app.
- Background color: Light blue (#D8E9F5), a desaturated version of the primary, creates a clean, professional backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#8E44AD), an analogous color to navy, provides contrast for interactive elements and highlights without being jarring.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, providing a modern, clean, and readable look. 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers, for a balance between modernity and classic grotesque style. Both fonts enhance the digital experience, perfect for an administrative portal.
- Use a set of consistent and professional icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Icons. Ensure icons are clear, understandable, and visually aligned with the app's design language. Ensure proper contrast and sizing for readability and usability.
- Design a clean and structured layout with a clear hierarchy. Use a grid system for alignment and responsiveness. Ensure that important actions are easily accessible. Consistent spacing and padding contribute to a professional user experience.
